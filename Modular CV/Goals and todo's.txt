    To Do list:
    dotted lines, but not just the table lines - done
    color scheme:
    dark grey, light grey, white text and dotted lines, blue or purple?
    I pretty much just want this format:
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    figure out how to make it work for mobile/small monitor through the text moving underneath under certain screen width.
    Use table to split the site in half X use div instead
    currently it resizes, which is not too bad but will become a problem with more content
    icon top middle?
    eventually split css from the html and use link - done
    favicon
    update information, really make sure it is as correct as possible
    align top middle instead of just middle
    lots and lots of formatting, come up with a text style and color scheme & learn how to apply it to the whole page
 No Longer using tables
    figure out how to set up custom table names for the CSS X
    add table headers for the head sections X
    custom dashes for the table X

    Do I want to get the text in and then go bottom up or top down?

Round 2:

    swap for div instead of tables, easier to use for layout - Done
    Set up styles in the CSS file
    How to let div box line up next to each other
    Add Extra Curricular & hobbies

    Slight New Idea:

    link    Page 1
    link    Page 2
    link    Page 3
    link    Page 4

    Every page has a concept, letting me make the formatting much more modular
    still be able to scroll, but there would probably be some more blank space. some sort of transition,
    so you see the whole pages content at once.
