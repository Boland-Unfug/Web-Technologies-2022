    I will be using this as my final option, where I have all the html elements in one file.
    This is due to being able to use links to scroll to specific content
    it also simplifies server side, and lets me make everything adjustable
    This truly only works because a CV is very simplistic and mostly just conveys information.

                I am a computer programmer in Ridgway, Colorado with a wide variety of interests and a passion for
                learning.
