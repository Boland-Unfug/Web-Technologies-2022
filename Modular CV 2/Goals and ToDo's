A list of my todos and ideas, especially since stuff is getting complicated

Goal of website:
functions as a one stop shop for any information one would consider for hiring.
have links to things like my resume

All key information
a picture of me
email
phone
linkedin
github links
top projects
a description of me
my previous jobs
my education
my skills

Phase one: make a site that has as much stuff as possible, lots of animations, will have a lot of space
this will most likely score well for the project, since it is feature rich and shows a deep understanding
one key point is I will need way better animations, and thus need to learn javascript
Phase two: make the site much more concise and elegant, trimming unnecessary features and pages
most people would probably not hire someone if it toke several clicks to get to information.
This is pretty much a glorified word document
Phase 3: combine the two through a 'simplification' popup in the menu that changes the site from 1 to 2



proposed color scheme:
light grey background, grey sections, dark grey boxes, white text

find a place for certifications and awards - could be description or education or menu idk
Check previous to do list and notebook for other ideas and tasks
fun idea, use margins and padding to create a diffuse effect
