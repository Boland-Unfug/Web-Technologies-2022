    I will be using this as my final option, where I have all the html elements in one file.
    This is due to being able to use links to scroll to specific content
    it also simplifies server side, and lets me make everything adjustable
    This truly only works because a CV is very simplistic and mostly just conveys information.

                    My interest in minecraft led me to create a minecraft server from scratch with a friend of mine.
                    I assisted with hosting, moderation, development, and building, which gave me a wide range of skills.
                    This includes an understanding of online server management, online conflict moderation, and minecraft mod development.

                    I taught a wide variety of ages, from kindergarten to 8th grade. 
                    Running a classroom improved my listening skills, patience, and my ability to communicate larger ideas.

                    In order to broaden my horizons further, I decided to take a semester abroad.
                    Studying in London provided many new challenges, both in school and out.
                    It showed me new ways to live and learn, different cultures and beliefs, and taught me self - reliance.

                    CEC Early College provided a better, more fulfilling experience, while also allowing for early college enrollment.
                    This is where I really started to program, taking a two year video game design course in c++ and python development.
