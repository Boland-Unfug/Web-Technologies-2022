A list of my todos and ideas, especially since stuff is getting complicated

Goal of website:
functions as a one stop shop for any information one would consider for hiring.
have links to things like my resume

All key information
a picture of me
email
phone
linkedin
github links
top projects
a description of me
my previous jobs
my education
my skills

Phase one: make a site that has as much stuff as possible, lots of animations, will have a lot of space
this will most likely score well for the project, since it is feature rich and shows a deep understanding
one key point is I will need way better animations, and thus need to learn javascript
Phase two: make the site much more concise and elegant, trimming unnecessary features and pages
most people would probably not hire someone if it toke several clicks to get to information.
This is pretty much a glorified word document
Phase 3: combine the two through a 'simplification' popup in the menu that changes the site from 1 to 2



proposed color scheme:
light grey background, grey sections, dark grey boxes, white text

find a place for certifications and awards - could be description or education or menu idk
Check previous to do list and notebook for other ideas and tasks
fun idea, use margins and padding to create a diffuse effect
Add a header in each seciton
CSS
    organize and try to make more concise - worked on Nov 23rd, made 25% more concise
    ids ??
    screen versions ?
    try to standardize measurements - Greatly improved, large containers like page, content and nav bar use vw and vh in relation to screen size, while all subcontainers use percentages.
    try to find a better way to make a phone vs laptop system - no
    try to fix font sizing, make a box and then make text fit in that box
    also fix the phone mode top margin
    Why is there the extra space around stuff? like on the left in phone mode, for both the nav bar items, which have no margins, as well as the little purple bits?
    look into scroll modifications

section coding todos:
    Nav bar

        fix font spacing
        make smaller
        animate
            on hover grow text size
            should displace other words
        add navigation arrow?
