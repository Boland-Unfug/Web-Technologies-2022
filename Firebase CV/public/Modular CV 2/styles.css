Here will be the universal styles for my CV/portfolio.
Structure
Divided into Content and Navbar, and being mobile and desktop compatable
Mobile and Desktop styling stored in seperate files
The content container is scrollable, and must be able to register on screen pages
Content will be divided into pages, each page is one screen size and holds a category such as menu
Each page has an ID for easy js manipulation, as well as for links.
all containers and elements within Content will be dynamic, using percentages and flex

The Navbar will be flexible but fixed so as to not scroll, and will move to top of screen for mobile
Links will show current page, change opacity on hover, and animate the scroll animation when clicked
